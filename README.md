# Permanent-file-Deletion

/* INSTRUCTION

cipher is already available with microsoft windows 2000, you just have to write in windows powershell(in adminstration mode) cipher /w:"your directory".(my directory was --- C:\Users\abhishek\Desktop\TESTING)

what this will do is overwrite the deleteded space with random 1,0 bits, in that way no recovery software will be able to recover the same file again.

NOTE - This process will take time, the larger the hard drive, the more the time it will take.
